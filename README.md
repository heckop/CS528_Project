Algorithmic implementation of Task Scheduling in Edge Server Systems with limited Solar Energy and Infinite Batteries

Given the M edge servers each equipped with a solar panel of capacity S and a battery with infinite capacity.
Assume a day has T time slots (for example T=24, 24 hours). Power generation for different time slot jth) of the day at each edge server (ith) is given as S[i][j] and S[i][j] â‰¤ S. 
The number of tasks that arrives at edge servers (ith) at different time slot (jth) of the day is given as D[i][j]. 
The values of S[i][j] and D[i][j] for all i and j are available at time 0. 
We know how much power generated at each edge server and how many number of tasks to arrive at each servers for all the time slot.
The task needs to be executed in the same time slot and if the task executed it consumes a unit (or 1) amount utilization. 
We may choose to execute the task or not execute the task in the time slot. 
The amount of power consumed in a time slot at an edge server is cube of the number of tasks executed in the time slot in that edge server. 
The compute capacity of each edge server is infinite.
In a time slot, we may choose to store some power generated by the solar at the edge server or we may utilize some already stored power to execute some extra tasks or may not do anything with the battery. 
If we have stored power in the battery in earlier slots at the edge server then only we can use the battery up to the stored amount in the current slot.
The task can be migrated to another edge server without any cost. 
Battery power cannot be transferred from one edge server to another server.
Design an efficient approach to maximize the total number of task executions for the entire day by all the edge servers.
